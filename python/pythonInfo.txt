Preliminaries: Python
---------------------
The short version:
------------------
Python is a versatile programming language that comes 
preinstalled on many platforms (MacOS X 10.7 and above,
most recent Linux distributions). To check if you have it
go to a unix prompt (open the terminal app if on a Mac) and type 
python or python3. You should get something like this,
    >python3
	Python 3.6.4 (v3.6.4:d48ecebad5, Dec 18 2017, 21:07:28) 
	[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)] on darwin
	Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

python specialized modules that contain some high level functions. The scripts 
included in this package use the numpy, scipy, and matplotlib modules. 
They may or not come with the version of python you have installed. 
The best way to make sure they are present is to try installing them 
Fortunately, that can be done using pip in one command in unix,

> python -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib

or 

> python3 -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib

Longer version
--------------
the code in this package is written in python. 
This language comes preinstalled on some OS platforms
however if you do not have it on you system it can easily 
be installed. There are basic installers available from the python 
Software Foundation,

https://www.python.org/downloads/

Some python scripts require specialized libraries to work. This code 
uses the libraries numpy (includes tools for using numeric arrays in python) 
and scipy (includes fuctions used for scientific computing in python) and 
matplotlib (MATLAB like plotting library). 
These need to be installed seperately after getting python set up.

This page provides resources for installing numpy and scipy libraries,

https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html

But I found the easist way to install and update these libraries is using pip,

> python -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib

The utility pip is included with python version 2.7 and onword. 

There are also 3rd party distributions of python that come with any library 
you might need such as,

Anaconda
https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

Enthought 
https://www.enthought.com/product/canopy/    (full IDE, not free but there is a trial version)

https://www.enthought.com/product/enthought-deployment-manager/ (command line version)

I have used Enthought (commandline version) but have no experience with Anacoda
and don't know how well it works. But it is widely adopted. There are others but 
these two are available on multiple OS platforms (Mac/Win/Linux).

Although you don't really need to know anything about python (hopefully) to run 
my scripts the Python Software Foundation has a good set of tutorials if you want 
to learn more.
