BEAM errata May 7, 2018

Although much care has been taken in development and testing 
of this software package there some combinations of parameters
that have not been thouroughly tested. This includes but is not 
limited to,

    Satshine
       -BEAM includes the capability to include the contribution 
       of photons originating from Saturn's surface (Solar photons 
       scattered by Saturn onto the rings). Although this feature 
       appears qualitatively consistant with expectations we have 
       not performed any tests that specifically target this feature.
       
    wakes
       - The granola model implemented in the set up code (either in 
       make_particles_wakes.F90 or mpw_iquad_xy.f90) includes the capabilty 
       to build particle field with self-gravity wakes. Although have generated 
       particle files with wakes (and done validation with these), we have 
       not run the BEAM MC code with targets with wakes.
       
    wake orientation
       - On a related note for wakes there is a parmeter that determines
       the orientation relative to the radial direction in the ring plane.
       We have gerated a few particle files with a non-zero "wake orientation"
       and using visualization tools the ring patch looks as we would expect. 
       But as above we have not used such targets with the MC code.
    
    Shadowing
       - One of the BEAM software's big advantages over similar codes is 
       using a Hapke model to simulate particle surface shadowing (as opposed 
       to intra-particle shadowing). We have done some testing of this feature 
       and it seems consistant with the theory.
